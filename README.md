# PPWCode.Vernacular.Wcf

This library is part of the PPWCode project and defines the wcf vernacular.


## Getting started

This is version I of the library, which is designed to work with Microsoft .NET 4.5.

## PPWCode

This package is part of the PPWCode project, developed by [PeopleWare n.v.].

More information can be found in the following locations:
* [PPWCode project website]
* [PPWCode Google Code website]

Please note that not all information on those sites is up-to-date. We are
currently in the process of moving the code away from the Google code
subversion repositories to git repositories on [GitHub].


### PPWCode .NET

Specifically for the .NET libraries: new development will be done on the
[PeopleWare GitHub repositories], and all new stable releases will also
be published as packages on the [NuGet Gallery].

We believe in Design By Contract and have good experience with
[Microsoft Code Contracts] and the related tooling.  As such, our packages
always include Contract Reference assemblies.  This allows you to also
benefit as a user from the contracts that are already included in the
library code.

The packages also include both the pdb and xml files, for debugging symbols
and documentation respectively.  In the future we might look into using
symbol servers.
